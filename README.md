# PM 2.5

PM is the abbreviation for Particulate Matter and the 2.5 designations signify the size of that particulate matter. The EPA defines PM2.5 levels as inhalable particles with diameters of 2.5 micrometers or smaller. These particles come in many sizes and shapes and can be made up of hundreds of different chemicals.
Some are emitted directly from a source, such as construction sites, unpaved roads, fields, smokestacks or fires. Most particles form in the atmosphere as a result of complex reactions of chemicals such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which are pollutants emitted from power plants, industries and automobiles.

# Project D3h06

Our project was to basically predict the levels of PM 2.5 matter in the air based on the following parameters
1. temperature
2. pressure
3. rain
4. wind direction
5. wind speed

of every hour of the days in the years from 2013 to 2017.
